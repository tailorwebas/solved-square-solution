Unzip and open the Square SolutionSquare Solution.sln file. Add a new class file named Square.vb to the project. The Square class should have one attribute: a side measurement. The side measurement may contain a decimal place and should always be greater than or equal to 0. The class should also have three behaviors: a default constructor, a function that calculates and returns the square’s area, and a function that calculates and returns the square’s perimeter. Code the Square class. Then, open the form’s Code Editor window and complete the calcButton_Click procedure. Display the calculated results with two decimal places. Save the solution and then start the application. Click the Exit button and then close the solution.
